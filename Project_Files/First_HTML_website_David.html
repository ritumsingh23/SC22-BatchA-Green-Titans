  What is Cost of Living
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cost of living is the amount of money it would cost you to live in a specific area or city. Cost of living, itself, may sound like it only refers to where you are actually staying like a house or an apartment, but it is ,in fact, much more. It takes into consideration everything that you could have to spend money on from gas to groceries.

    <h2>
      Why
    </h2>
    <p>
      The reason our team created the Cost of living project is because it would be extremely useful to the world if we do it correctly. We want to give people more information when they are planning to leave and live somewhere else. This project will give people more confidence going into their new life so they do not get surprised by the price of anything.

    <h2>
      How / Basic Idea
    </h2>
    <p>
      This website is very easy to follow and will be accessible to anyone who has an internet connection. Just put in a name of a city that you have thought about living and then our database will find your city and give you the numbers.If the city you request is not inn our extensive library of cities our AI will calculate the prices based on the other cities in the area and you will be informed that the price is not certain.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Other Attributes (trash name but I cant figure out what to put)
    </h2>
    <p>
      On top of idea we also are bringing new and special additions to our website. We will have a feature where, if you have not chosen a city or you are just curious,you can input a budget that you have set for yourself and our code will give you all the cities in our price range. You will also get a picture of the city along with an interactive map showing the surrounding area.
