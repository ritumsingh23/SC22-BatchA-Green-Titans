<h1>Random Forest</h1>
<body style="background-color:silver">
  <h3>What is Random Forest?</h4>
  <p>Random forest is a machine learning model. This model uses a bunch of decision trees to put in the input and calculates the output based on the mean or mode of the predictions made by the decision trees. </p>
  <h3>What is a Decision Tree?</h4>
  <p>A decision tree is another machine learning model which takes the input and predicts the output through(wip) </p>
  <h3>Pros and cons of Decision Tree</h3>
  <ul>Pros:
    <li>can be used for classification and regression</li>
    <li>works well with non-linear data</li>
    <li>works efficiently with large datasets</li>
    <li>has a higher level of accuracy compared to decision tree</li>
    <li>has many parameters</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>Cons:
    <li>does not work well with linear data</li>
    <li>is known to overfit</li>
    <li>slow training</li>  
  </ul>
