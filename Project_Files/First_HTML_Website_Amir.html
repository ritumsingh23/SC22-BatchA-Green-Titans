  </h2>
  <p h1 style="color: White">
   Lasso regression is a type of linear regression that is more accurate. This variant of linear regression uses shrinkage, which helps the results become more accurate. This type of regression specializes in models showing high levels of multicollinearity. Lasso regression is also a regularization  technique. This means that the data will most likely not overfitting. This linear regression technique has proven itself to be reliable and accurate
